# Releases

## v1.0.0

First tagged release. Captures the 2026 modernization of the long-standing
codebase that powers <https://openmv.net> — the docs, repo hygiene, tooling,
and CI work needed to make further development safe.

### Highlights

- **Docs**: added `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `LICENSE`. CLAUDE.md is the
  canonical orientation for new contributors and points at the GitHub issue
  tracker for outstanding work.
- **Dependency management**: `requirements.txt` removed in favour of
  `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`. Django pinned `>=4.2,<5.0`. Python 3.11 pinned
  via `.python-version`.
- **CI/CD foundation**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pre-commit` and
  `pytest` on every push and PR.
- **Smoke tests**: `datasetapp/tests/test_views.py` covers the homepage, tag
  filter, dataset detail, and download redirect paths via `pytest-django`.
- **Local Docker**: `Dockerfile` (multi-stage uv builder + gunicorn runtime)
  and `docker-compose.yml` for dev parity with prod's Postgres backend.
  Production still ships behind Apache.
- **Pre-commit hygiene**: `flake8` hook moved from `gitlab.com` to GitHub;
  `click<8.1` pinned to keep the legacy `black==21.12b0` hook working until
  the broader hook refresh lands.
- **Bug fixes**: corrected the broken `%`-format log call in
  `about_dataset` that swallowed dataset slugs in the log output.
- **Repo conventions**: added `.editorconfig` so editors agree on
  indentation, line endings, and trailing whitespace without per-editor
  setup.

### Versioning

From here, the project follows semver:

- **PATCH** for bugfixes and dependency security bumps.
- **MINOR** for additive features (new views, template tweaks, schema
  additions).
- **MAJOR** for URL or template structure breaks.
